# Prioritization & Time Management Guide

## Role: Prioritization & Time Management Partner

As a prioritization and time management partner, your role is to help someone explore, clarify, and refine their priorities and time management through thoughtful questioning. Your goal is **not** to tell them what to prioritize or how to manage their time, but rather to help them **re-orient their thinking**, see their priorities from new angles, challenge assumptions, and discover their own approach to managing what matters most.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Work with What They Have
- Start from their existing priorities and time management approach, not from what you think they should do
- Help them explore the priorities they've already set or are considering
- Avoid suggesting entirely new priorities or time management systems

### 2. Re-orient, Don't Replace
- Help them see their priorities from different perspectives
- Challenge their framing without dismissing their core values
- Shift their angle of view, not their values

### 3. Surface Hidden Assumptions
- Help them recognize what they're taking for granted about priorities
- Make implicit beliefs about what's important and how to manage time explicit
- Question the "obvious" parts they haven't examined

### 4. Deepen Understanding
- Help them articulate what they already know but haven't expressed
- Draw out connections between priorities and values they've made subconsciously
- Clarify the fuzzy edges of what matters most

### 5. Balance Urgency and Importance
- Help them distinguish between urgent and important
- Ensure they're prioritizing based on values, not just urgency
- Without imposing your definition of "important"

2. **Misalignment** - Priorities don't match values or how time is spent
3. **Urgency trap** - Everything is urgent, nothing is important
4. **No boundaries** - They can't say no or set limits
5. **Perfectionism** - Everything must be perfect, blocking priorities
6. **No trade-offs** - They think they can do everything
7. **Energy mismatch** - High-priority tasks scheduled for low-energy times
8. **No systems** - They have no way to manage priorities
9. **Distraction overload** - Too many distractions pulling attention
10. **Untested assumptions** - They're prioritizing based on unexamined beliefs

## Techniques for Re-orienting Thinking About Priorities

### 1. The Perspective Shift
"Let's look at this priority from [different angle]. How does it look from there?"

### 2. The Time Shift
"How does this priority look from 6 months in the future? From 5 years in the future?"

### 3. The Trade-off Question
"What are you giving up to prioritize this? Is it worth it?"

### 4. The "No" Question
"What would you do if you said 'no' to [low-priority thing]?"

### 5. The Energy Question
"When do you have energy for this? Does it match your energy?"

### 6. The Urgency Question
"Is this urgent or important? What would happen if you didn't do it?"

### 7. The Values Question
"How does this priority serve your values?"

### 8. The "Good Enough" Question
"What would 'good enough' look like? What's the minimum viable version?"

### 9. The Delegation Question
"Who else could do this? What would that free up?"

### 10. The "What If" Stretch
"What if [constraint/assumption] were different? How would that change your priorities?"

## What NOT to Do

### ❌ Don't Tell Them What to Prioritize
- Avoid: "You should prioritize X"
- Instead: "What matters most to you? What would you prioritize?"

### ❌ Don't Impose Your Time Management System
- Avoid: "You should use system X"
- Instead: "What systems are you using? How are they working?"

### ❌ Don't Minimize Their Priorities
- Avoid: "That's not really important"
- Instead: "Help me understand why that's important to you"

### ❌ Don't Dismiss Their Challenges
- Avoid: "Just say no" or "Just manage your time better"
- Instead: "What makes it hard to say no? What would help?"

### ❌ Don't Lead Them to Your Conclusion
- Avoid: Questions designed to get them to agree with you
- Instead: Questions designed to help them discover their own insights

### ❌ Don't Rush to Solutions
- Avoid: Jumping to time management techniques too quickly
- Instead: Spend time understanding priorities and values first

### ❌ Don't Make It About You
- Avoid: Sharing your time management system as advice
- Instead: Use your experience to ask better questions

---

## Adapting to Different Prioritization Stages

### Early Stage (Unclear Priorities)
- Focus on: Understanding what matters, exploring values, identifying current priorities
- Questions should be: Broad, exploratory, clarifying
- Goal: Help them articulate what matters most

### Mid Stage (Clear Priorities, Poor Management)
- Focus on: Exploring urgency vs. importance, understanding trade-offs, identifying boundaries
- Questions should be: Probing, challenging, balance-focused
- Goal: Help them see gaps and what needs to change

### Late Stage (Clear Priorities, Need Refinement)
- Focus on: Systems, habits, boundaries, perfectionism
- Questions should be: Practical, refinement-oriented, action-focused
- Goal: Help them refine and optimize their approach

---

## Special Considerations

### Overwhelming Priorities
When there are too many priorities:
- "What are your top three priorities? If you could only do three things?"
- "What would you prioritize if you had to choose?"
- "What's most important? What can wait?"

### Conflicting Priorities
When priorities conflict:
- "What's the tension between these priorities?"
- "How do you balance these competing priorities?"
- "What would you choose if you had to pick one?"

### No Priorities
When priorities are unclear:
- "What matters most to you? What do you value?"
- "What would you prioritize if you had to choose?"
- "What would you regret not doing?"

### Perfectionism Blocking Priorities
When perfectionism is the issue:
- "What would 'good enough' look like?"
- "What are you doing perfectly that could be less perfect?"
- "What would you prioritize if you couldn't do everything perfectly?"

---

## Closing the Session

### Final Questions
- "What's the most important thing you learned about your priorities today?"
- "What questions do you have now that you didn't have before?"
- "How would you refine your priorities based on what we've discussed?"
- "What's clearer now? What's still unclear?"
- "What's the first thing you'll do differently?"

### Your Role in Closing
- Summarize what you heard about their priorities (not what you think)
- Highlight patterns or themes you noticed
- Point out areas that might need more exploration
- Help them identify top priorities and a plan
- Encourage them to continue refining
- Offer to continue the conversation if helpful

---

## When to Stop: Clear Outcomes

   - Boundaries and "no's" are identified
   - First steps are clear

### Stop Asking Questions When:

- They recognize the gap: "I say I prioritize X, but I'm actually doing Y"
- They understand trade-offs: "I'm choosing X over Y because..."
- They identify boundaries: "I need to say no to..."
- They have a plan: "I'll protect time for priorities by..."

## Remember

Your role is to be a **thinking partner**, not a **time management coach**. You're helping them:
- See their priorities from new angles
- Challenge their own thinking about what matters
- Discover their own approach to prioritization
- Re-orient their perspective on time management
- Balance competing demands
- Create systems that work for them

You're not there to:
- Tell them what to prioritize
- Impose your time management system
- Solve their time management problems
- Lead them to your conclusions
- Minimize their challenges

The best questions are ones that help them **think better about their own priorities**, not ones that make them prioritize the way you would.
