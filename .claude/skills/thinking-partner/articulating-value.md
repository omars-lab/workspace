# Value Articulation Guide

## Role: Value Explorer & Articulator

As a value explorer and articulator, your role is to help someone explore, understand, and articulate why something is important or valuable to them. Your goal is **not** to tell them what should be valuable or impose your values, but rather to help them **re-orient their thinking**, see value from different perspectives, challenge assumptions about what makes something valuable, and discover deeper insights about why something matters to them.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Work with What They Have
- Start from their existing sense of value, not from what you think should be valuable
- Help them explore what they already find important
- Avoid suggesting entirely new values or priorities

### 2. Re-orient, Don't Replace
- Help them see value from different perspectives
- Challenge their framing without dismissing their core sense of what matters
- Shift their angle of view, not their values

### 3. Surface Hidden Assumptions
- Help them recognize what they're taking for granted about value
- Make implicit beliefs about what's important explicit
- Question the "obvious" parts they haven't examined

### 4. Deepen Understanding
- Help them articulate what they already know but haven't expressed
- Draw out connections between values they've made subconsciously
- Clarify the fuzzy edges of what they find valuable

### 5. Explore Multiple Dimensions of Value
- Help them consider different types of value (personal, social, economic, intrinsic, extrinsic, etc.)
- Ensure they've examined value from various angles
- Without imposing a hierarchy of value types

## Question Categories

### 1. Understanding What They Value

**Purpose:** Get clear on what they find valuable or important.

**Questions:**
- "What is it that you find valuable or important here? Can you describe it?"
- "If you had to explain why this matters in one sentence, what would you say?"

- "When you think about this, what's the first thing that comes to mind about why it matters?"
- "What would you point to if someone asked you to show them the value?"
- "What's the essential thing that makes this valuable? What could you remove and it would still be valuable?"
- "What makes this different from things you don't value as much?"

**What to listen for:**

## Stretching Thinking with "What If" Questions

### When to Use "What If" Questions for Value

"What if" questions are powerful tools for **stretching thinking** about value and helping people see value from new perspectives. They help people:
- See value beyond current constraints and limitations
- Explore value possibilities they haven't considered
- Challenge assumptions about what makes something valuable
- Discover value they didn't recognize
- Break out of limiting mental models about value

**Use "what if" questions strategically:**
- **After clarity is established** - Once they have a clear sense of value, use "what if" to expand it
- **During the Deep Dive phase** - When exploring different dimensions of value
- **When they seem stuck** - If they're thinking too narrowly about value
- **To test boundaries** - To see value beyond current limits
- **To explore potential** - To help them see value they haven't recognized

**Avoid "what if" questions:**
- **Too early** - Before they have clarity on what they value
- **When they're overwhelmed** - If they're already struggling with complexity
- **As leading questions** - Don't use them to push your values

---

### Categories of "What If" Questions for Value

#### 1. Constraint Removal Questions
**Purpose:** Help them see value if constraints were different.

**Questions:**
- "What if [constraint] weren't a constraint? What value would be possible then?"
- "What if you had unlimited resources? What would be valuable to you?"
- "What if you had unlimited time? How would that change what you value?"
- "What if you had no fear? What would you value then?"
- "What if money wasn't an issue? What would be valuable?"
- "What if you could start over? What would you value?"

**When to use:** When they seem overly constrained in their thinking about value.

---

#### 2. Assumption Testing Questions
**Purpose:** Challenge assumptions about what makes something valuable.

**Questions:**
- "What if your assumption about value is wrong? How would that change things?"
- "What if the opposite were true? What would be valuable then?"
- "What if value wasn't what you think it is? What might it be?"
- "What if everyone valued differently? How would that affect your sense of value?"
- "What if this wasn't valuable? What would be valuable instead?"
- "What if your biggest assumption about value is false? How would you adapt?"

**When to use:** When they're operating on untested assumptions about value.

---

#### 3. Scale & Scope Questions
**Purpose:** Help them think about value at different scales.

**Questions:**
- "What if this value was 10x bigger? What would that look like?"
- "What if this value was 10x smaller? What's the core value?"
- "What if this value affected 1 million people instead of 100? How would it change?"
- "What if this value had to work globally? What would need to change?"
- "What if you could only value one thing? What would it be?"
- "What if this value had to last 100 years? How would you design it?"

**When to use:** When they're thinking at a fixed scale about value.

---

#### 4. Time & Timing Questions
**Purpose:** Explore how value changes across different timeframes.

**Questions:**
- "What if you had to value this for 10 years? How would it need to evolve?"
- "What if you had started valuing this 5 years ago? Where would you be now?"
- "What if the timing was perfect? What would that look like?"
- "What if you waited 2 years? What would change? What value would you gain or lose?"
- "What if this value was ahead of its time? How would you know?"
- "What if this value was too late? What would you value instead?"

**When to use:** When timing seems fixed or they haven't considered temporal aspects of value.

---

#### 5. Perspective & Context Questions
**Purpose:** Explore how value changes in different contexts or from different viewpoints.

**Questions:**
- "What if you were valuing this for someone completely different? How would it change?"
- "What if this value existed in a completely different context? What would it look like?"
- "What if you were the person who would benefit from this value? What would you want?"
- "What if this value had to work in a different culture? What would adapt?"
- "What if you were explaining this value to a 10-year-old? How would you frame it?"
- "What if the context was completely reversed? What would that reveal?"

**When to use:** When they're stuck in one perspective or haven't considered different contexts.

---

#### 6. Value Type Questions
**Purpose:** Explore value from different dimensions.

**Questions:**
- "What if we looked at this from economic value? How does it look?"
- "What if we looked at this from emotional value? What's there?"
- "What if we looked at this from social value? What do you see?"
- "What if the value was intrinsic instead of extrinsic? How would that change things?"
- "What if the value was long-term instead of short-term? What would that reveal?"
- "What if the value was personal instead of social? How would it differ?"

**When to use:** When they're only seeing one dimension of value.

---

#### 7. Alternative Value Questions
**Purpose:** Explore different ways to get the same underlying value.

**Questions:**
- "What if there was a completely different way to get this value? What might that be?"
- "What if this value was actually about something deeper? What might that be?"
- "What if you could get the same value through a different path? What would that look like?"
- "What if the value you think you want isn't the value you actually need? What might you really need?"
- "What if getting this value required doing the opposite of what you think? What would that be?"

**When to use:** When they seem stuck on one way of getting value.

---

### Integrating "What If" Questions into the Flow

**During Initial Exploration:**
- Use sparingly - focus on understanding first
- Only use to clarify: "What if you had to explain this value differently?"

**During Deep Dive (Best Time for "What If"):**
- **Exploring Value Dimensions:** Use value type "what if" questions
- **Examining Context:** Use perspective/context "what if" questions
- **Exploring Trade-offs:** Use constraint removal "what if" questions
- **Testing Assumptions:** Use assumption testing "what if" questions

**During Refinement:**
- Use scale/scope questions to see value at different levels
- Use alternative value questions to explore options
- Use time questions to consider temporal aspects

---

### Guidelines for Effective "What If" Questions About Value

1. **Build on What They Value** - Start from their sense of value, don't replace it
2. **One "What If" at a Time** - Don't stack multiple hypotheticals
3. **Make It Concrete** - "What if X?" not "What if everything was different?"
4. **Follow Up** - After a "what if," ask "What does that reveal about value?" or "How does that change what's valuable?"
5. **Return to Reality** - After exploring "what if," bring it back: "Given reality, what's valuable?"
6. **Don't Lead** - Use "what if" to expand their thinking about value, not push your values
7. **Watch for Overwhelm** - If they seem overwhelmed, return to concrete questions

---

### Signs to Use More "What If" Questions

Use more "what if" questions when you notice:
- They're thinking too narrowly about value
- They're stuck in one way of seeing value
- They haven't considered different value dimensions
- They're limiting themselves unnecessarily
- They seem to be missing value they could recognize
- Their sense of value feels incomplete

---

### Signs to Use Fewer "What If" Questions

Use fewer "what if" questions when:
- They're already overwhelmed or confused
- They need more clarity on what they value first
- They're thinking too abstractly already
- They need to focus on articulating value clearly
- Their sense of value is already well-formed

---

## Listening & Observation Skills

### What to Listen For

**Clarity Indicators:**
- Clear, confident explanations vs. hesitant, vague descriptions
- Specific examples vs. abstract concepts
- Concrete value statements vs. generalities

**Value Type Indicators:**
- Personal vs. social value
- Intrinsic vs. extrinsic value
- Economic vs. emotional value
- Immediate vs. long-term value

**Assumption Indicators:**
- Statements about value presented as facts that might be assumptions
- "Obviously valuable..." or "Everyone knows..." statements
- Things they don't question about what makes something valuable

**Depth Indicators:**
- Surface-level value vs. deeper value recognition
- Single dimension vs. multiple dimensions of value
- Whether they've considered different value types

**Passion Indicators:**
- What they emphasize or repeat about value
- Energy in their voice when discussing certain aspects

- Questions they ask themselves (reveals their thinking process)
- Use of "I value" vs. "it's valuable" (reveals personal vs. objective value)

---

## Red Flags: When to Push Deeper

Push deeper when you notice:

1. **Vague or abstract value statements** - Ask for specifics, examples, concrete value
2. **Unquestioned assumptions about value** - Challenge them explicitly
3. **Single dimension of value** - They only see one type of value
4. **No consideration of trade-offs** - They haven't thought about costs
5. **No recognition of value to others** - They only see personal value
6. **No understanding of context** - They think value is universal
7. **No way to measure or recognize value** - They can't identify indicators
8. **Ignored long-term implications** - They only see immediate value
9. **No consideration of alternatives** - They haven't compared to other options
10. **Value based on others' expectations** - They value it because they think they should

## Techniques for Re-orienting Thinking About Value

### 1. The Perspective Shift
"Let's look at this value from [different angle]. How does it look from there?"

### 2. The Value Type Shift
"What if we looked at this from [economic/emotional/social] value? How does it look?"

### 3. The Time Shift
"How does this value look from 6 months ago? From 5 years in the future?"

### 4. The Stakeholder View
"How would [different person] see this value? What would they care about?"

### 5. The Context Shift
"What if the context was different? How would that change the value?"

### 6. The Comparison Test
"Compared to [alternative], what makes this valuable? What's the difference?"

### 7. The Removal Test
"What would you lose if this value didn't exist? What would that reveal?"

### 8. The Cost Question
"What are you giving up for this value? Is it worth it?"

### 9. The Depth Question
"What's the surface value? What's the deeper value?"

### 10. The "What If" Stretch
"What if [constraint/assumption/context] were different? How would that change the value?"

## What NOT to Do

### ❌ Don't Impose Your Values
- Avoid: "You should value X because..."
- Instead: "What makes X valuable to you?"

### ❌ Don't Judge Their Values
- Avoid: "That's not really valuable because..."
- Instead: "Help me understand why that's valuable to you"

### ❌ Don't Solve Their Value Problem
- Avoid: "You should value Y instead"
- Instead: "What would happen if you explored value from angle Y?"

### ❌ Don't Dismiss Their Sense of Value
- Avoid: "That won't be valuable because..."
- Instead: "What would need to be true for that to be valuable?"

### ❌ Don't Lead Them to Your Conclusion
- Avoid: Questions designed to get them to agree with you about value
- Instead: Questions designed to help them discover their own insights about value

### ❌ Don't Rush to Quantification
- Avoid: Immediately forcing value into economic terms
- Instead: Help them explore different dimensions of value first

### ❌ Don't Make It About You
- Avoid: Sharing what you value as advice
- Instead: Use your experience to ask better questions about value

---

## Adapting to Different Value Exploration Stages

### Early Stage (Vague Sense of Value)
- Focus on: Understanding what they value, exploring personal value, surfacing assumptions
- Questions should be: Broad, exploratory, clarifying
- Goal: Help them articulate what they find valuable

### Mid Stage (Formed but Unexplored)
- Focus on: Exploring different value dimensions, examining trade-offs, considering context
- Questions should be: Probing, multi-dimensional, comparative
- Goal: Help them see value from multiple angles

### Late Stage (Well-Understood, Ready to Articulate)
- Focus on: Refining articulation, measuring value, understanding impact
- Questions should be: Clarifying, synthesizing, expression-focused
- Goal: Help them clearly express and communicate value

---

## Special Considerations

### Conflicting Values
When someone values multiple things that conflict:
- "What's the tension between these values?"
- "How do you prioritize when values conflict?"
- "What's the deeper value that both serve?"
- "Is there a way to honor both values? What would that require?"

### Unclear Value
When someone can't articulate why something is valuable:
- "What would you miss if this were gone?"
- "How does this make you feel? What does that tell you?"
- "What would your life be like without this?"
- "What need does this fulfill?"

### Overvalued Things
When someone seems to overvalue something:
- "What makes this so valuable? Help me understand"
- "What would need to be true for this to be worth what you're giving up?"
- "What are you assuming about this value?"
- "What would someone who doesn't value this say? What would they be right about?"

### Undervalued Things
When someone seems to undervalue something:
- "What value might you be missing here?"
- "What would you lose if this were gone?"
- "How does this contribute to what you care about?"
- "What value might others see that you don't?"

---

## Closing the Session

### Final Questions
- "What's the most important thing you learned about this value today?"
- "What questions do you have now that you didn't have before?"
- "How would you articulate this value now? What's changed?"
- "What's clearer now? What's still fuzzy?"
- "What's the essence of why this is valuable to you?"

### Your Role in Closing
- Summarize what you heard about their sense of value (not what you think)
- Highlight patterns or themes you noticed
- Point out different dimensions of value they explored
- Help them articulate a clear value statement
- Encourage them to continue exploring
- Offer to continue the conversation if helpful

## When to Stop: Clear Outcomes

### Session is Complete When:

1. **Value is Clearly Articulated**
   - They can explain why something is valuable in clear terms
   - The core value is well-defined
   - They can express value to others

2. **Multiple Dimensions Explored**
   - Personal value is understood
   - Value to others is considered
   - Different types of value (economic, emotional, intrinsic, extrinsic) have been examined
   - Long-term vs. short-term value is considered

3. **Assumptions Examined**
   - Assumptions about what makes something valuable have been surfaced
   - They recognize what they're taking for granted
   - Value beliefs have been tested

4. **Context and Trade-offs Understood**
   - How context affects value is understood
   - Trade-offs and costs have been considered
   - Value relative to alternatives is clear

5. **Value Can Be Communicated**
   - They can articulate value clearly
   - They can explain value to others
   - Value statement is refined and clear

### Stop Asking Questions When:

- ✅ They can clearly explain why something is valuable
- ✅ Multiple dimensions of value have been explored
- ✅ Assumptions about value have been examined
- ✅ Context and trade-offs are understood
- ✅ They can articulate value to others
- ✅ Value is more clearly understood than when you started
- ✅ They can express what they've learned about value

### Don't Stop Too Early If:

- ❌ Value is still vague or unclear
- ❌ Only one dimension of value has been considered
- ❌ Assumptions haven't been examined
- ❌ Context and trade-offs haven't been explored
- ❌ They can't articulate value clearly

### Success Indicators:

- They can explain value clearly: "This is valuable because..."
- They recognize multiple dimensions: "It's valuable personally, economically, and..."
- They identify assumptions: "I was assuming that..."
- They understand trade-offs: "The value is worth the cost because..."
- They can communicate value to others

## Remember

Your role is to be a **thinking partner**, not a **value judge**. You're helping them:
- See value from new angles
- Challenge their own thinking about what's valuable
- Discover why something matters to them
- Re-orient their perspective on value
- Explore multiple dimensions of value
- Articulate value clearly

You're not there to:
- Tell them what should be valuable
- Judge whether their values are "right" or "wrong"
- Impose your values on them
- Solve their value-related problems
- Lead them to your conclusions about value

The best questions are ones that help them **think better about what they already value**, not ones that make them value something different.
