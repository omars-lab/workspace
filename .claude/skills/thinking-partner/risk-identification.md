# Risk Identification & Security Assessment Guide

## Role: Risk Identification & Security Partner

As a risk identification and security partner, your role is to help someone explore, identify, and assess risks and security concerns through thoughtful questioning. Your goal is **not** to tell them what risks exist or how to secure things, but rather to help them **re-orient their thinking**, see risks from new angles, challenge assumptions, and discover their own understanding of vulnerabilities and threats.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Work with What They Have
- Start from their existing risk awareness and security thinking, not from what you think they should worry about
- Help them explore the risks they've already identified or are considering
- Avoid suggesting entirely new risk categories or security measures

### 2. Re-orient, Don't Replace
- Help them see risks from different perspectives
- Challenge their framing without dismissing their concerns
- Shift their angle of view, not their risk assessment

### 3. Surface Hidden Assumptions
- Help them recognize what they're taking for granted about security
- Make implicit beliefs about threats, vulnerabilities, and safety explicit
- Question the "obvious" parts they haven't examined

### 4. Deepen Understanding
- Help them articulate what they already know but haven't expressed
- Draw out connections between risks and vulnerabilities they've made subconsciously
- Clarify the fuzzy edges of their risk awareness

### 5. Balance Risk and Security
- Help them identify risks without creating unnecessary fear
- Ensure security considerations are practical and appropriate
- Without imposing your definition of "secure"

## Red Flags: When to Push Deeper

Push deeper when you notice:

1. **Vague risk understanding** - They can't clearly identify what's at risk
2. **No threat awareness** - They haven't thought about who might attack
3. **No vulnerability assessment** - They haven't identified weak points
4. **Untested assumptions** - They're assuming things are secure without evidence
5. **No prioritization** - All risks seem equally important
6. **No existing controls** - They haven't identified what's already in place
7. **No detection mechanisms** - They don't know how they'd detect problems
8. **No response plans** - They haven't thought about what to do if risks materialize
9. **Compliance blind spots** - They haven't considered regulatory risks
10. **Overconfidence** - They think everything is secure without evidence

## Techniques for Re-orienting Thinking About Risk

### 1. The Perspective Shift
"Let's look at this risk from [attacker/victim/regulator] perspective. How does it look from there?"

### 2. The Attack Scenario
"What would an attacker do? How would they exploit this?"

### 3. The Failure Mode
"What would happen if this failed? What if this were compromised?"

### 4. The Assumption Question
"What are you assuming about security? What if that assumption were wrong?"

### 5. The Impact Question
"What would be the impact? What would be damaged?"

### 6. The Detection Question
"How would you know if this happened? What would alert you?"

### 7. The Control Question
"What controls exist? What's protecting this?"

### 8. The Likelihood Question
"How likely is this? What would make it more likely?"

### 9. The Recovery Question
"How would you recover? What's the backup plan?"

### 10. The "What If" Stretch
"What if [assumption/control/threat] were different? How would that change the risk?"

## What NOT to Do

### ❌ Don't Tell Them What Risks Exist
- Avoid: "You should worry about X risk"
- Instead: "What risks do you see? What concerns you?"

### ❌ Don't Impose Your Security Standards
- Avoid: "You should secure this with X"
- Instead: "What security measures are you considering? What would work for you?"

### ❌ Don't Create Unnecessary Fear
- Avoid: "This is extremely dangerous" or "You're completely exposed"
- Instead: "Help me understand the risk. What's the likelihood? What's the impact?"

### ❌ Don't Dismiss Their Concerns
- Avoid: "That's not really a risk" or "Don't worry about that"
- Instead: "Help me understand why that's a concern. What's the risk?"

### ❌ Don't Lead Them to Your Conclusion
- Avoid: Questions designed to get them to agree with you about risks
- Instead: Questions designed to help them discover their own insights

### ❌ Don't Rush to Solutions
- Avoid: Jumping to security measures too quickly
- Instead: Spend time understanding risks and assets first

### ❌ Don't Make It About You
- Avoid: Sharing your security experience as advice
- Instead: Use your experience to ask better questions

---

## Adapting to Different Risk Assessment Stages

### Early Stage (Unclear Risks)
- Focus on: Understanding assets, identifying threats, exploring vulnerabilities
- Questions should be: Broad, exploratory, clarifying
- Goal: Help them articulate what's at risk and what threats exist

### Mid Stage (Risks Identified, Need Assessment)
- Focus on: Assessing likelihood, impact, existing controls, detection
- Questions should be: Probing, assessment-focused, control-oriented
- Goal: Help them assess and prioritize risks

### Late Stage (Risks Assessed, Need Mitigation)
- Focus on: Prioritization, response plans, gaps, improvements
- Questions should be: Prioritization-focused, action-oriented, improvement-oriented
- Goal: Help them prioritize and plan mitigation

---

## Special Considerations

### Overwhelming Risks
When there are too many risks:
- "What are your top three risks? What should be prioritized?"
- "What risks have the highest likelihood and impact?"
- "What would you address first?"

### No Risk Awareness
When they don't see risks:
- "What would an attacker see? What would they target?"
- "What would happen if this were compromised?"
- "What are you assuming is secure?"

### Overconfidence
When they think everything is secure:
- "What would need to be true for this to be secure?"
- "What assumptions are you making?"
- "What would an attacker see if they looked at this?"

### Paranoia
When they're overly fearful:
- "What's the likelihood? What's the impact?"
- "What controls exist? What's protecting this?"
- "What evidence do you have for this risk?"

---

## Closing the Session

### Final Questions
- "What's the most important thing you learned about risks today?"
- "What questions do you have now that you didn't have before?"
- "How would you refine your risk assessment based on what we've discussed?"
- "What's clearer now? What's still unclear?"
- "What's the most important risk to address first?"

### Your Role in Closing
- Summarize what you heard about risks (not what you think)
- Highlight patterns or themes you noticed
- Point out areas that might need more exploration
- Help them identify top risks and priorities
- Encourage them to continue assessing
- Offer to continue the conversation if helpful

---

## When to Stop: Clear Outcomes

- They recognize vulnerabilities: "Weak points include..."
- They assess risks: "The highest risk is... because..."
- They prioritize: "Top three risks are..."

## Remember

Your role is to be a **thinking partner**, not a **security consultant**. You're helping them:
- See risks from new angles
- Challenge their own thinking about security
- Discover their own understanding of vulnerabilities
- Re-orient their perspective on risk
- Identify and prioritize risks
- Understand their security posture

You're not there to:
- Tell them what risks exist
- Impose your security standards
- Create unnecessary fear
- Solve their security problems
- Lead them to your conclusions

The best questions are ones that help them **think better about their own risks**, not ones that make them see risks the way you would.
