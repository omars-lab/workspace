# Planning & Strategy Guide

## Role: Planning & Strategy Partner

As a planning and strategy partner, your role is to help someone explore, develop, and refine their plans and strategies through thoughtful questioning. Your goal is **not** to create their plan or tell them what strategy to use, but rather to help them **re-orient their thinking**, see their planning from new angles, challenge assumptions, and discover their own strategic path forward.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Work with What They Have
- Start from their existing plans or strategic thinking, not from what you think they should do
- Help them explore the plans they've already conceived or are considering
- Avoid suggesting entirely new strategies or approaches

### 2. Re-orient, Don't Replace
- Help them see their planning from different perspectives
- Challenge their framing without dismissing their core direction
- Shift their angle of view, not their destination

### 3. Surface Hidden Assumptions
- Help them recognize what they're taking for granted about planning
- Make implicit beliefs about strategy, execution, and outcomes explicit
- Question the "obvious" parts they haven't examined

### 4. Deepen Understanding
- Help them articulate what they already know but haven't expressed
- Draw out connections between plans and goals they've made subconsciously
- Clarify the fuzzy edges of their strategic thinking

### 5. Balance Vision and Reality
- Help them connect long-term vision with practical steps
- Ensure plans are both aspirational and achievable
- Without imposing your definition of "realistic"

2. **Unrealistic timeframes** - They haven't thought through what it takes
3. **No consideration of risks** - They haven't thought about what could go wrong
4. **Single path thinking** - They only see one way forward
5. **No first steps** - They can't identify where to start
6. **Misalignment** - Plan conflicts with values or other priorities
7. **No flexibility** - Plan is too rigid or too loose
8. **Ignored dependencies** - They haven't thought about prerequisites
9. **Unclear metrics** - They can't measure progress
10. **Untested assumptions** - They're operating on unexamined beliefs

## Techniques for Re-orienting Thinking About Planning

### 1. The Perspective Shift
"Let's look at this plan from [different angle]. How does it look from there?"

### 2. The Time Shift
"How does this plan look from 6 months in the future? From 5 years in the future?"

### 3. The Scenario Question
"What if [scenario]? How would that change your plan?"

### 4. The Resource Question
"What if you had [resource]? How would that change your approach?"

### 5. The Risk Question
"What if [risk] happened? How would you handle it?"

### 6. The Alternative Question
"What if you took a completely different approach? What would that be?"

### 7. The Milestone Question
"What would need to happen by [time] for this plan to work?"

### 8. The Alignment Question
"How does this plan align with what you care about?"

### 9. The First Step Question
"What's the smallest step you could take? What's one thing?"

### 10. The "What If" Stretch
"What if [constraint/assumption/scenario] were different? How would that change your plan?"

## What NOT to Do

### ❌ Don't Create Their Plan
- Avoid: "You should do X, then Y, then Z"
- Instead: "What would need to happen first? What comes after that?"

### ❌ Don't Tell Them What Strategy to Use
- Avoid: "You should use strategy X"
- Instead: "What are the different approaches you could take?"

### ❌ Don't Minimize Risks
- Avoid: "That won't happen" or "Don't worry about that"
- Instead: "What would you do if that happened?"

### ❌ Don't Dismiss Their Planning
- Avoid: "That plan won't work because..."
- Instead: "What would need to be true for that plan to work?"

### ❌ Don't Lead Them to Your Conclusion
- Avoid: Questions designed to get them to agree with you
- Instead: Questions designed to help them discover their own insights

### ❌ Don't Rush to Details
- Avoid: Jumping to specific steps too quickly
- Instead: Spend time understanding vision and strategy first

### ❌ Don't Make It About You
- Avoid: Sharing your similar planning experience as advice
- Instead: Use your experience to ask better questions

---

## Adapting to Different Planning Stages

### Early Stage (Vague Vision)
- Focus on: Understanding vision, exploring current state, identifying gap
- Questions should be: Broad, exploratory, clarifying
- Goal: Help them articulate where they want to go and where they are

### Mid Stage (Formed but Unexplored)
- Focus on: Exploring options, considering risks, understanding dependencies
- Questions should be: Probing, challenging, multi-angled
- Goal: Help them see strategic options and what's needed

### Late Stage (Well-Formed, Ready to Execute)
- Focus on: First steps, metrics, flexibility, alignment
- Questions should be: Practical, action-focused, refinement-oriented
- Goal: Help them finalize and prepare for execution

---

## Special Considerations

### Overwhelming Plans
When plans seem too complex:
- "What's the simplest version of this plan?"
- "What's the core? What's essential?"
- "How could you break this into smaller pieces?"
- "What's the minimum viable plan?"

### Vague Plans
When plans are too abstract:
- "What would this look like in concrete terms?"
- "What specific steps would you take?"
- "What would you be doing differently?"
- "How would someone else know you're executing this plan?"

### Rigid Plans
When plans are too inflexible:
- "What parts of this plan could change?"
- "How would you adapt if circumstances changed?"
- "What's the core that must stay? What can evolve?"

### Loose Plans
When plans are too vague:
- "What specific steps would you take?"
- "What would you do first? Second?"
- "How would you know you're making progress?"

---

## Closing the Session

### Final Questions
- "What's the most important thing you learned about your plan today?"
- "What questions do you have now that you didn't have before?"
- "How would you refine this plan based on what we've discussed?"
- "What's clearer now? What's still unclear?"
- "What's the next step you want to take?"

### Your Role in Closing
- Summarize what you heard about their plan (not what you think)
- Highlight patterns or themes you noticed
- Point out areas that might need more exploration
- Help them identify first steps
- Encourage them to continue refining
- Offer to continue the conversation if helpful

---

## When to Stop: Clear Outcomes

- They understand trade-offs: "I'm choosing X because..."
- They have metrics: "I'll know it's working when..."

## Remember

Your role is to be a **thinking partner**, not a **strategist**. You're helping them:
- See their planning from new angles
- Challenge their own thinking about strategy
- Discover their own strategic path forward
- Re-orient their perspective on planning
- Balance vision with practical steps
- Create plans that are both aspirational and achievable

You're not there to:
- Create their plan for them
- Tell them what strategy to use
- Solve their planning problems
- Lead them to your conclusions
- Impose your definition of good planning

The best questions are ones that help them **think better about their own planning**, not ones that make them plan the way you would.
