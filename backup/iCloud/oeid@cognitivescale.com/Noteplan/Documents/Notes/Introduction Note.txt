# Introduction Note

ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to NotePlan! ðŸŽ‰

NotePlan supports and extends Markdown. Make use of it to create Todos and events in your calendar. Use it also to make your note easier to read. 

Hover the left side of a note or use the menubar to mark your Todos.

## Todos (thatâ€™s a title)
* Todos start with '* ' or '- '.
* They can be marked as 

	* [x] Done (orange in calendar)
	* [>] Scheduled (blue in calendar, will be copied for you)
	* [-] Cancelled (not shown in your calendar)
	* <- Click on the star to check it off as done.
	
* Press `Tab/Backtab` to shift Todos as I have done above.
* Start titles with '# ' to separate Todos for different Projects for example.

If you `schedule` a Todo through the menu on the left with the ðŸ•˜ icon, it will be automatically copied for you (you can also select multiple Todos along with a title).

## More Markdown
The minimum you should know about Markdown is described above. But here are a few more things you should know:

You can make text **bold** or *italic*. Or mark them like `this` (inline code). If you add a time like @12:00. It will be shown on the calendar.

Look for the `?` left of each note (hover the left area) to get an overview.

**Lists**:
1. One
2. Two
3) Three
4) Four
* Five
* Six
