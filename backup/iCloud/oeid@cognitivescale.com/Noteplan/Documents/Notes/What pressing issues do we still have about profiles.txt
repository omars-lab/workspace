# Profile Documentation
- [ ] What is the purpose of the profile?
		- [ ] Should profiles help us answer common questions asked about the end user!
			- [ ] What are common questions asked about an end user? 
			- [ ] Is there a criteria to these common questions? 
				- [ ] For example, a common question asked about people is "What is your name" ... do things like the user's name belong in the profile?
		- [ ] Should profiles help us reason about what information is relevant for a specific user?
			- [ ] Should we only need to look at the profile and not elsewhere to determine what is relevant for a user?
		- [ ] Should the profile provide a holistic picture of the user? 
			- [ ] Who are the user's friends?
			- [ ] What social media accounts does the user have? 
			- [ ] What different applications does the user use?
		- [ ] Profiles should help us holistically understand the behavior of our users
			- [ ] An average, how many times a day do my application users 
			- [ ] What percentage of my users are active?
				- [ ] Are there any unique/similar features that distinguish active users from inactive users?
					- [ ] Should the profile contain enough information to distinguish users?
		- [ ] Should the profile be a materialized view ... 
			- [ ] Should it contain a record for every time the user logged into the application or only the total over the past 7 days?
			- [ ] ... or should the profile only contain the features needed to drive models that answer valuable questions about our users?
				- [ ] For example, we may need to know only how many times the user logged in with the past month, and how many of them were at different hours ...
		- [ ] What different models will the profile power???
		- [ ] What is the main mission of insights, profiles, and feedback? 
			- To address the following question: "How can I effortlessly learn about my users as I present new insights to them?" ?
- [ ] What is the value of profile?
	- [ ] How are profiles used?
		- [ ] What use cases can profiles support?
			- [ ] What do we expect each user to be able to do with profiles ... What should users be able to do with the profile ...
				- Roll back attributes generated for a certain user ...?
				- Submit profile building events ...
				- Must we be able to "match" similar profiles?
				- Can we automatically match products to profiles?
					- Can we derive user affinities to product attributes and attach them to the profile?
- [ ] What are common questions people first learning about profiles have?


# Profile Methodology
- [ ] How do I fit profiles into my use case?
- [ ] Where does FPI fit into skill lab?
	- [ ] What is the purpose of skill lab?
		- [ ] Dig through Jons Slide
			- Connect data 
			- Cleanse data
			- Feature Engineer

			- Package 
			- Deploy to an env
	- Connect data
		- Ingest Feedback

		- Create models that learn specific profile attributes from feedback
	- Package
	- Deploy to an env
		- Deployed Insights API to serve insights
- [ ] How does FPI integrate with studio?
	- [ ] Can we do things like I depend on a "TraderProfile"
	- [ ] Or I produce a trader profile ... instead of listing individually all of the attributes ...

# Profile Design
- [ ] What entities should have separate profiles?
- [ ] What belongs in a profile??? (What questions is the profile trying to answer???)
	- [ ] What should I save in it??? 
	- [ ] Should I put any and everything in it??? Should only information that relates to insights reside with the profile???
	- 	What kind of data answers these questions?
		- 		What attributes do model's depend on ...
		- 		Maybe the data that belongs within the profile depends on the models using the profiles ... 
		- 		What are commonly used attributes???
		- Is there the risk for overkill here from profile standpoint ... i.e labeling feature generation features as profile features?
			- ... we want to go from profile data to ml model features quickly ... is this transformation considered functionality of the profile ... or some other feature deriver ...
	- 	For profiles ... is it enough to mark specific sets of information that might tie back to users?
		- 		This insight has a sub sector ... I want to track sub-sector and see if there is a true affinity between whether or not a user clicks an insight based on sub-sector ...
		- This insight has certain keywords ... I want to see the total number of insights a user clicked on, viewed, ... based on the keywords associated with the insight ...

# Profiles for Real Time Ranking
- [ ] Is there a recent usage / recent feedback section of the profile that gets automatically maintained from the clickstream?
	- [ ] Should we track a user's recent clickstream??

# Profiles at scale
- [ ] How often are "derivable" profile attributes recomputed?
- [ ] How often is the decay on profile attributes re-evaluated?
- [ ] Are the profiles for all entities recomputed frequently? or only active users?
	- [ ] Do we have smart caching models to figure out who should get cached ... and who shouldnt?
- [ ] How often are profile clusters recomputed?
