- #Thought @Thought Feeling a little lost with the experimentation ... where do we start??? What are we trying to prove???
- #Thought @Thought We want to arrive how this will fit into cortex ... but we don't even know if the thing we are making will be a skill, standalone tool, .... 
	- We don't know how we will have to advance the architecture of cortex to support this ...
	- We don't know what it means from a munging / aggregating data perspective ....
	- We don't know if this can be effectively implemented in Javascript or not ... We don't know if it will scale ... We are not taking advantage of bringing the compute to the data ... 

- #Thought @Thought I'm hoping to rope in Sukant from an architectural perspective ...
