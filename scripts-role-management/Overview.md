These scripts help me manage my roles ...

- [ ] Should I move these over to my cli?

	- [ ] Make a script to help derive vscode links for a directory ...
	- [ ] Make a script to tell me which initiatives are missing a front matter header
	- [ ] Make a script to tell me which files are big / have lots of tasks and which ones are small ...
	- [ ] Make a script to tell me which files have "needs" / "habits"
	- [ ] Make a script to find all the learning tasks ...
	- [ ] Make a script to group initiatives ...

	- [ ] Make a script to help reduce initiatives ...
		- [ ] I should find initiatives with similar learning tasks ...
	- [ ] Figure out how to orchestrate these scripts ...
